# gen-io-ts

This small project is a code generation project to generate the [`io-ts`](https://gcanti.github.io/io-ts/) Codecs based on the
`interface`s and `type alias` documented in the main module.

## How it works

1. [`ts-morph`](https://ts-morph.com/) is used to parse all the TS files in the main module.
2. Based on the parsing output, [`io-ts-codegen`](https://github.com/gcanti/io-ts-codegen) is used
   to generate the `io-ts` Codecs. However, this library is unable to generate Codecs for some type
   definitions - such as type definition which take type arguments. To support these types string
   templates are used.

Please see the section further down on 'TS code requirements' for other syntax which needs to be considered
when writing code in the main module. (Or for when things don't seem to generate correctly.) As there were
still some cases that were to complex to support.

## Example 1
Given a simple type defined as `interface`

```typescript
inteface InterfaceA {
  someString: string;
  someNumber?: number;
  someBoolean?: boolean;
}
```
the output is
```typescript
const InterfaceACodec = t.intersection([
  t.type({
    someString: t.string,
  }),
  t.partial({
    someNumber: t.number,
    someBoolean: t.boolean,
  }),
])
```

## Example 2
Given a simple type defined as `type alias`

```typescript
type TypeA = "a" | "b" | 3;
```
the output is

```typescript
const TypeACodec = t.union([
  t.literal('a'),
  t.literal('b'),
  t.literal(3),
])
```

## Example 3
Given a more complicated type that extends from another type

```typescript
interface InterfaceB extends InterfaceA {
    someArray: string[]
}
```
the output is
```typescript
const InterfaceBCodec = t.intersection([
  t.type({
    someString: t.string,
  }),
  t.partial({
    someNumber: t.number,
    someBoolean: t.boolean,
  }),
  InterfaceACodec
])
```

## TS code requirements
1. If a type definition is for an object, it must be declared by `interface`.
   For example, instead of doing this:
```typescript
 type A = {
   prop: string
 }
```
we should do this:
```
 interface A {
   prop: string;
 }
```
2. When a type definition is imported, the import must be a named type import.
```typescript
 import type { A } from 'X';
```

3. For an Array type, it must be defined in this style:
```
 type A = string[]
```
rather than this:
```
 type A = Array<string>
```

## Unsupported
1. For `type alias` that accepts type arguments, use interface instead.
2. For `interface` where type arguments and recursive types are both used, while this
   complicated type definition in theory can be supported, we don't have such a type yet and the implementation
   will require a lot more effort.
